# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

### Getting Started

* Fork this repository to your account
* * Use Bower to install Font Awesome and jQuery (see below)

### Features
The following features should be supported

* Allow for two players to add x and o characters on a board
* Detect when a player has won by having 3 Xs or 3 Os in a row, column or diagonal.
* Use [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to display x and o characters

### Adding more features

* Display which player's turn it is on the screen
* Restart the game after a player has won - perhaps a restart button?
* Add messages into the HTML for indicating that a player has won or if a square has already been played (ie: do not use alert).
* Create a branch for this project called gh-pages and use it to publish your game to the web. If you do this correctly, it should be available at https://yourusername.github.io/tictactoe
* Customize it and make it your own!
